  <h2>
      Statistical Test
  </h2>
  <div>
      <h3>
          1.1
      </h3>
      <p>
          The statistical test used to analyse the New York City Subway Data was the Mann Whitney U test.
          The null hypothesis is that the ridership of the subway on rainy and non rainy days is equivalent.
          I used a one tailed P value with a significance (p-critical value) of 5%, to determine if the ridership on rainy days was
          significantly higher than on days with no rain.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.2
      </h3>
      <p>
          This test is applicable because the underlying distributions are not normal (therefore making the test more effective than
          a t-test) and have different sample sizes, variances. The Mann Whitney U test does not make any assumptions regarding
          the distribution, sample size and variance.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.3
      </h3>
      <p>
          The p-value returned from the test (using a normal approximation of the U statistic for large sample sizes) is 0.0000027
          which is below the significance level of 0.05. The mean ridership on rainy days is 2028 and 1846 for non rainy days.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.4
      </h3>
      <p>
          The statistical test indicated that it was significantly unlikely that the ridership on rainy days is equivalent to the ridership
          on non rainy days. It leads us to believe that ridership is higher on days with rain.
      </p>

          Linear Regression

      <h3>
          2.1
      </h3>
      <p>
          Since we had already been exposed to gradient descent in the problem sets, I chose to use the ordinary least squares model
          from the statsmodel library.
      </p>
      <h3>
          2.2
      </h3>
      <p>
          I used the advanced dataset; the features I used in my model are rain, hour, day_week, weekday, wspdi,
          meanwspdi, fog, meantempi,  tempi, precipi, meanprecipi, meanpressurei, pressurei.
      </p>
      <p>
          I also included two dummy variables. These were the set of turnstile units, and the set of weather conditions on a given day.
      </p>
      <h3>
          2.3
      </h3>
      <p>
          I tried to include any variable that has an affect on the environment or determines a location in space/time.
