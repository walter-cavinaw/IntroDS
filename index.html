      Statistical Test
  </h2>
  <div>
      <h3>
          1.1
      </h3>
      <p>
          The statistical test used to analyse the New York City Subway Data was the Mann Whitney U test.
          The null hypothesis is that the ridership of the subway on rainy and non rainy days is equivalent.
          I used a one tailed P value with a significance (p-critical value) of 5%, to determine if the ridership on rainy days was
          significantly higher than on days with no rain.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.2
      </h3>
      <p>
          This test is applicable because the underlying distributions are not normal (therefore making the test more effective than
          a t-test) and have different sample sizes, variances. The Mann Whitney U test does not make any assumptions regarding
          the distribution, sample size and variance.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.3
      </h3>
      <p>
          The p-value returned from the test (using a normal approximation of the U statistic for large sample sizes) is 0.0000027
          which is below the significance level of 0.05. The mean ridership on rainy days is 2028 and 1846 for non rainy days.
      </p>
      <h3>
          1.4
      </h3>
      <p>
          The statistical test indicated that it was significantly unlikely that the ridership on rainy days is equivalent to the ridership
          on non rainy days. It leads us to believe that ridership is higher on days with rain.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Linear Regression
      </h2>
      <h3>
          2.1
      </h3>
      <p>
          Since we had already been exposed to gradient descent in the problem sets, I chose to use the ordinary least squares model
          from the statsmodel library.
      </p>
      <h3>
          2.2
      </h3>
      <p>
          The features that I chose from the advanced dataset are rain, hour, day_week, weekday, wspdi,
          meanwspdi, fog, meantempi,  tempi, precipi, meanprecipi, meanpressurei, pressurei.
      </p>
      <p>
          I also included two dummy variables. These were the set of turnstile units, and the set of weather conditions on a given day.
      </p>
      <h3>
          2.3
      </h3>
      <p>
          I tried to include any variable that has an affect on the environment or determines a location in space/time.
          <ul>
            <li>
                turnstile unit (dummy variable): This feature is the single best variable for determining ridership.
                Naturally the location of a subway station should be a great indicator for how many people will use it. By using this variable the
                location of the station is implied by the turnstile units.
            </li>
            <li>
                weather condition (dummy variable): The weather condiditons are another factor that would contribute to a person's decision
                to use public transportation as apposed to walking or biking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hour: This would also intuitively determine ridership. Any one who has taken public transit
                or drives tries to avoid the times of the day when many people have just finished work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Day of week: There would be an expectation that weekdays and weekends would have a significant effect on ridership.
                Then there are other days of the week when people may be more likely to drive such as Fridays.
            </li>
            <li>
                rain, fog, meanprecipi & precipi: I included these variables because they I believe that people are less likely to drive/walk/bike when it is raining.
                It can be unpleasant to be outdoors in this weather and can impair driving too.
            </li>
            <li>
                meantempi & tempi: Similar to the above I believe that people are more likely to walk and bike on warm days. These variables can account for that.
            </li>
            <li>
                meanwspdi, wspdi, meanpressurei & pressurei: These variables where included because they were able to increase the fit
                of the line and do not decrease the integrity of the model. The variables represent environmental factors which affect
                human behaviour.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>

          The coefficients for the non-dummy variables are as follows:

          2.6
      </h3>
      <p>
          For social and behavioural data, an R-squared over 0.4 can be considered significant.
          Given that the dataset falls into this category, an R-squared of .493 would make the ordinary-least-squares method
          appropriate for this data set.

          This histogram shows the frequency that an amount of ridership happends on a given day. It is apparent that the ridership is not
          normally distributed and rather follows an exponential distribution.

          This figure shows the entries through turnstile units by day of the week. The number of entries on a given day was averaged
          and then displayed along with the day. The data follows our general intuition that on weekdays there is significantly more use
          than on weekends. It is surprising however to see that Mondays have quite a lower average than other weekdays.

          Conclusion
      </h2>
      <h3>
          4.1
      </h3>
      <p>
          From the mann-whitney u test and the results of the ordinary least squares regression model I can confidently state
          that more people ride the subway on rainy days. This naturally aligns with our
          intuition that a person would be less inclined to ride their bike or walk when such conditions prevail.
      </p>
      <h3>
          4.2
      </h3>
        <p>
          There are several factors that contribute to the above stated conclusion. Before starting the analyses I believed that this would be the case,
          and with a higher median and mean for ridership on rainy days
          I could hypothesize that ridership on rainy days is higher than ridership on non-rainy days.
          First we can consider the results of the non parametric significance test -- the mann-whitney u test.
          We showed here that the data from rainy days and non-rainy days did not come from the same population. This along with the higher median,
          and mean suggest that rainy day ridership is higher.
          After proceeding to the least squares regression model, we get the following coefficients of the variables representing precipitation, rain, and mean precipitation.
          <ul>
            <li>
                rain: -158.8137
            </li>
            <li>
              precipitation (precipi): -2852.1931
            </li>
            <li>
              Mean precipitation (meanprecipi): 8659.9360
            </li>
          </ul>
          This data can be misleading because it is unclear whether rain and precipitation actually increase ridership. From these coefficients
          we could conclude that higher daily mean precipitation increases ridership, but then we are left wondering: why does rain have a negative weight?
          I was suspicious that the precipitation and mean precipitation (and other environmental variables) were having an effect on this. After removing all weather
          variables except rain, the coefficient for rain was 111.85, which supports my initial conclusion: higher daily mean precipitation increases ridership, which implies that rainy days increase ridership.
        </p>
      <h2>
      Reflection
      </h2>
        <p>
        The dataset only included data over the span of the month of May in 2011. This dataset may not be representative of the ridership anymore.
        It is possible that something has changed the behaviour of people since then or it may be the case that something caused people to behave
        differently than usual over the course of that month.
        I used a one-tailed p value with the null hypothesis that rainy days were more likely to produce higher ridership. The scipy mann whitney u test does not
        show the sum rank and mean rank for the two sample, but the descriptive statistics and least squares model did not indicate the opposite of the hypothesis.
        For this reason I did not feel it was necessary to calculate the mean and sum rank of the mann whitney u.
